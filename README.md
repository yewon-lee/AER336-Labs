# AER336-Labs
Labs for AER336: Scientific Computing at the University of Toronto.

This course concerns numerical methods for scientific computation. Topics include interpolation, integration, linear systems, least-squares fitting, nonlinear equations and optimization,initial value problems, and partial differential equations.  

Six labs covered MATLAB implementations of numerical algorithms from scratch, relating to the following topics:
- Lab1- Linear interpolation and cubic splines
- Lab2- Numerical integration via composite gauss rules and adaptive quadrature
- Lab3- LU factorization and regression
- Lab4- Solving nonlinear equations via bisection and newton's method, optimization
- Lab5- Numerically solving ODEs via Forward Euler and implicit multistep methods
- Lab6- Numerically solving of first and second order PDEs (BVPs, IVPs)
